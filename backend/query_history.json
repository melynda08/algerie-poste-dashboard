It doesn't track their journey *from* Algeria after that initial registration.  Therefore, a trend plot of shipments *leaving* Algeria cannot be created from this dataset alone.

Here's the count of each event type from the provided data:\n\n* **Exp\u00e9dition d'envoi \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger (EDI-re\u00e7u):** 28\n* **Recevoir envoi au bureau d'\u00e9change (Ent):** 1\n* **Recevoir envoi au bureau de livraison (Ent):** 3\n* **Vaine tentative de livraison d'envoi (Ent):** 2\n* **Transmettre envoi \u00e0 l'agent de livraison (Ent):** 2\n* **Livraison d'envoi (Ent):** 2\n* **R\u00e9ception d'envoi du client (Srt):** 1\n* **Exp\u00e9dier envoi \u00e0 adresse nationale (Srt):** 1\n* **Exp\u00e9dier envoi \u00e0 adresse nationale (Ent):** 1\n\n\nA bar chart would visually represent these counts.  Each event type would be labeled on the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis would represent the number of times that event occurred.  The bar for \"Exp\u00e9dition d'envoi \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger (EDI-re\u00e7u)\" would be significantly longer than the others.  Because creating a visual chart is beyond my capabilities as a text-based AI, I've provided the data necessary for you to easily construct the bar chart using any spreadsheet software (like Excel or Google Sheets) or charting library.\n"
